# SwiftUI Audio Player with TCA

This project demonstrates how to build a simple audio player using SwiftUI, AVFoundation, and The Composable Architecture (TCA). It features playback controls, speed adjustments, and current playback time display.

## Features

- **Play and Stop Audio**: Play and stop audio playback with simple controls.
- **Adjustable Playback Speed**: Cycle through different playback speeds (0.5x, 1x, 2x, 2.5x) with a single button.
- **Current Time Display**: Observe and display the current playback time of the audio.
- **Modern SwiftUI Interface**: Built entirely using SwiftUI for a clean and responsive UI.
- **The Composable Architecture**: Utilizes TCA for state management and side effects.
